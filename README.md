# kubernetes-bootcamp
This is the official kubernetes bootcamp

The goal of the bootcamp content is to introduce developers/ first time users to Kubernetes. By the end of the bootcamp they will know: what Kubernetes does and how to deploy generic containerized applications on top of it.
They will become also familiar with main kubernetes concepts.

The bootcamp assumes users have some knowledge of software containers (Docker, rkt, etc).
